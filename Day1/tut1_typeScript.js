/**
 *  Static Typing (TypeScript, Java, C#): Types are checked at compile time, and you need to declare types explicitly or let the        compiler infer them.
    Dynamic Typing (JavaScript, Python, Ruby): Types are checked at runtime, so variables can hold values of any type, and type errors only appear when the code runs.
